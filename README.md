## 📝 Description

This Snake Game is a canvas-based arcade game developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It focuses on smooth and playable mechanics, performance awareness through a real-time FPS counter, and a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Players control the snake to collect apples, increase their score, and avoid collisions with walls or the snake’s own body.  
When the game ends, a popup displays the final score, high score, and time played, with an option to retry.
